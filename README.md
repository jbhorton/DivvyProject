This is simply a collection of Python, SQL, and R code documents or records that I used to process "Case Study 1: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?", a capstone project in the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. I conducted an in-depth analysis of Divvy bike-sharing service data, exploring how casual and annual members use the service differently. I leveraged course materials, individual research, and Generative AI models to help me strageize, check myself, and code.
